This repository contains shared code and executables for the course project that are in the DSoak
directory and a folder with my personal code for the class project. The game contains processes that 
communicate back and forth to determine the status of each process involved in the game.
The processes include a game manager, a registry, a player, a balloon store, a water server, and an umbrella supplier.
